**Abstract**

This research explores the linguistic competence of large language models (LLMs) by
analyzing their performance using the Spanish Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability
(EsCoLA). We examined the correlation between word frequency and model accuracy
and the impact of human annotator difficulty (measured by Fleiss Kappa) on model
performance. Despite previous studies suggesting a relationship between word
frequency and LLM performance, our findings indicate no significant correlation.
Both average word frequency and the frequency of the least common word in a
sentence did not predict model accuracy. Similarly, while we found a moderate
positive correlation between Fleiss Kappa and model accuracy, it was not strong
enough to be statistically significant. Our results suggest that factors other than word
frequency, such as syntactic and semantic cues, may better explain LLM performance.
Further research is needed to explore these factors and enhance our understanding of
LLM linguistic competence.
